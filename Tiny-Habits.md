# Tiny Habits

## 1. Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg

### Question 1  
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea for me was that change does not require strong motivation. Instead, starting with very tiny habits like doing two push ups or flossing one tooth can create long term behavior change.

## 2. Tiny Habits – Core Message

### Question 2  
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?

B = MAP means Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt come together.

* M stands for Motivation  
* A stands for Ability  
* P stands for Prompt  

To make a habit easier, increase ability by making the habit very small, attach it to a clear prompt, and do not depend only on motivation.

### Question 3  
Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

Celebration creates positive emotion in the brain. When we feel good immediately after doing a habit, the brain remembers it and makes it easier to repeat. Emotion builds habits, not repetition alone.
