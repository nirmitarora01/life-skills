# Platform as a Service (PaaS)

## Introduction
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that is commonly used by developers to build, test, and deploy applications. It lies between Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). PaaS allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about server setup or infrastructure management. This approach helps in faster development and ensures better scalability of applications.

## How PaaS Works
PaaS provides a complete development environment that includes preconfigured libraries and tools. The cloud provider manages computing resources such as servers, networking, and storage. Essential tools, frameworks, and runtime environments are also provided, which helps developers develop and deploy applications efficiently.

## Advantages of PaaS
* Reduced coding time
* Reduced cost
* Faster application development
* Easy scalability and maintenance
